            <h2>Safeguarding tips:</h2>
            <p>> The best way to protect yourself from a malicious link is to make sure you don't click on any.</p>
            <p>> Don’t share your passwords with others.Use a different password for each of your accounts, and change your passwords regularly. </p>
            <p>> Enabling multifactor authentication (MFA) can significantly reduce the likelihood of a cybercriminal taking over your account.</p>
            <p>> If possible, avoid using public computers or devices. Public computers might contain software that captures passwords and PINs, which others can then access </p>
            <p>> Many public hotspots, such as wireless networks in airports, hotels and restaurants, reduce their security settings so it’s easier for individuals to access these networks</p>
            <p>> Review your account activity and monthly account statements thoroughly as soon as they’re available. make sure your financial instituition has your current contact information</p>
